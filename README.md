## Welome to a kata a day repo.

I've taken on a personal challenge of solving 1 kata a day.
The katas are kindly provided by codewars.com, takeuforward.org 
and people who share entry challenges for coders from their interviews.

The katas that come from codewars don't have any testing bc test suite is provided by kata author.
